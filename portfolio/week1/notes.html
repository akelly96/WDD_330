        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Design for mobile devices first.
            </li>
            <li>
                By creating desktop first, you don't account for touch interaction.
            </li>
            <li>
                Start small and scale up.
            </li>
            <li>
                The less steps it takes to complete an action the better.

            <li>
                Make the most common button in reach distance for mobile devices.
            </li>
            <li>
                Menus should be at the bottom of mobile devices
            </li>
            <li>
                Some people still do not recognize the hamburger button as the menu button. Use the word menu instead.
            </li>
            <li>
                Buttons should be big enough to click on in mobile devices
            </li>
            <li>
                The number pad, not the keyboard, should be used for number inputs
            </li>
            <li>
                Do not use pop-up ads
            </li>
            <li>
                Ads should be simple and not overpowering.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Questions:</h4>
        <ol>

                When would one ever use local storage?
            </li>
            <li>
                How long can local storage store a variable? Where does it store it?
