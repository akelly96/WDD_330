        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <ul> 
            <li>
                Use memoization (caches) to store variables that take a lot time to process/render
            </li>
            <li>
                Use immediately invoked functions for temporary variables.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you only need to run a function once, there is no need to create a reusable function.
            </li>
            <li>
                Only use strict mode inside temporary functions.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can redeine a function inside itself. Afther the function is called once, it will change.
            </li>
            <li>
                Recursion is a function calling itself until a certain condition is met.
            </li>
            <li>
                The wait() function works asynchronously and will deploy something in a specified amount of time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Separate tasks into functions. One function should perform one task.
            </li>
            <li>
                A promise is used to execute something after something else happens.
            </li>
            <li>
                .then is used to tell the computer what to do after a promise is complete
            </li>
            <li>
                .catch is used if the promise fails.
            </li>
            <li>
                Writing async in front of a function causes that function to run asynchronously with others being called.
            </li>
            <li>
                The fetch API is a promise.
            </li>
